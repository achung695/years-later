        <h1>2. A World in a Digital Screen</h1>
        
        <p>Year 12,018 B.C.—(Still...) New Age Year 6,056 (N.A.)
<hr />
    <br>
    <br>
	By the time Chris got to the screening room, everyone was seated and waiting for him. The Teacher who was in charge shot a spicy glance at him, wordlessly commanding his quiet entrance. Chris followed.
    <br>
    <br>
    “Everyone, thank you for your patience.” 
    <br>
    <br>
    The Teacher—dressed in a grey, boring uniform with black heels and having an indistinguishable face even in an institution with merely 50 people—spoke as she glowered at Chris, turning on the huge VR (Virtual Reality) screen in front of the children. Lena matched eyes with him for a second, but without changing expression, she turned her eyes to the glowing screen again. A huge machine, installed somewhere in the walls, hummed loudly as the VR screen turned bright blue, soon displaying a familiar scenery of the <b>VSMH World</b> (<b>Virtual Society of Modern Humans</b>).
    <br>
    <br>
	“Now, please put on your VR helmets.”
    <br>
    <br>  
	As children clicked on their helmets, they soon became immersed in the Virtual Society (World), where nearly all humans took residence now. Two brightly glowing words popped up dully in Chris’s vision: Hello, World!
    <br>
    <br>
	“If everyone has finished wearing the helmet, I will activate the VR system now. Enjoy your ride!”
    <br>
    <br>
	Then, the Teacher pressed one prominently marked button—which was normally encased in three glassy protective layers (Chris didn’t know what they were made out of)—and Chris lost consciousness.
    <br>
    <br>
                                                ***
    <br>
    <br>
    Lying on an abandoned railroad, Chris awoke. Behind his horizontal silhouette loomed a giant, glowing, iron figure—the Society’s primary residence, the <b>Temnein City</b>! Turning his head to the left, he saw the intimidating construction that emitted a bright blue light continuously—it was his first time seeing it properly. Millions of buildings, schools, construction sites, ghettos, stacked together like a pile of pancakes—on top of that, hovering cars and airplanes drew translucent cyan glow on the starry night sky. Quietly, he breathed out a terse exclamation of awe, saying:
    <br>
    <br>
    “…Wow.”
    <br>
    <br>
    Now that he’d surveyed the surroundings, he tried to get up. Feeling the granules of white sand beneath his long fingers, he straightened his spine and got to his feet—then, he noticed something ghastly…
    <br>
    <br>
    “…Huh…?!”
    <br>
    <br>
    …That he had <i>grown up</i>!
    <br>
    <br>
    “What the hell? Hey, my body’s so big! And so tall! What’s going on around here…?”
    <br>
    <br>
	Although he spoke out loud, he was sure nobody could hear him. Since Temnein City was at least a several kilometers away from where he currently stood, he was sure he’d have to do some walking before he could reach the City. Jeez, ol’ Teacher bastard—she should’ve at least dropped me at a convenient spot to reach our destination, eh? Chris thought to himself.
    <br>
    <br>
	After some looking around, Chris found no particularly interesting points around his environment. There lied just a few rocks, cactuses, a rough white sand covering the floor, the City ominously looming at a distance, and just this…abandoned track extending as far as eye could see. But no stations. 
    <br>
    <br>
	He decided to start walking.
    <br>
    <br>
    Because it was a Virtual Reality System, there was no physical pain he could feel. Just a little pressure toward his feet when he was walking, which came as normal. But no buildup of stress, fatigue, or even sleepiness. 
    <br>
    <br>
    “But, this <i>is</i> pretty impressive, huh…? I wonder where all the others are….”
    <br>
    <br>
    Lena. Chris remembered how everyone in his class, including his best friend Lena, had worn a VR helmet with him. Then, he remembered the incident before that—his meeting with that mysterious girl in a secret room. He wanted to find her again once he got back to the real world, but now that he was here…he had to get to the City as quickly as possible. Somehow, Chris knew that that was his only way home.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
	“I think I’ve walked for a while now…. But the City isn’t getting any closer.”
    <br>
    <br>
	Chris huffed in mental exhaustion (since his body did not feel any pain, obviously). It was then that he heard a whooshing sound of a glowing airship that glided smoothly through the atmosphere. Detecting Chris, the airship readied its cannon and locked the target to him. 
    <br>
    <br>
    “<i>An unusual object detected…fire in three, two, one—!</i>”
    <h1><b>Bam!</b></h1>
    <br>
    Chris barely dodged the attack, flinging his body into the air. Coughing up the white dust that filled his mouth disgustingly, he cursed under his breath as he ran.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>“What the heck!!!”</h2>
    <br>
    “<i>Failed to eliminate…small-sized unidentified mobile object still present in the area. Close to the II-CB, must destroy object before it reaches 1st quadrant of II-CB.</i>”
    <br>
    <br>
    “What’s II-CB…wait!”
    <br>
    <br>
    Like flashing images of life you see before death, Chris recalled the pages of textbook he used to study back in the center. The definition of II-CB: the <b>Imaginary Internet-Controlled Barrier</b>. As lousy as he was at running, he often easily remembered things he learned in class from the Teachers. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Basically, the barrier protected any mysterious objects from entering the City. It was just another security measure humans took to protect themselves from any errors that might exist in the Virtual Society System, or the Internet.
    <br>
    <br>
    And Chris also remembered that there was something called the <b>Breach Point</b>. A certain location where objects could break into the barrier without triggering police. 
    <br>
    <br>
    “If I get to the barrier…*<i>huff!</i>* I can find the Breach Point by feeling the wall with my fingers! …*<i>huff!</i>* Aaaaarrrgghh, STOP SHOOTING!!!!”
    <br>
    <br>
    Now, the shots were getting close. Three or four laser beams later that left red slashes on his face and legs, Chris touched the Barrier for the first time—it was like touching a thick water wall held together by a strong artificial gravity. 
    <br>
    <br>
    “There! Now if I just find a point where the Barrier glows bright blue when I touch it….”
    <br>
    <br>
	When barely five minutes have passed, Chris found the Breach Point. The moment he touched the surface of it, a blue circular wave encircled his finger and rapidly spread throughout the invisible wall, tracing its semi-circular form. For the first time, Chris thought it was beautiful—the artificial human construct built to protect.
    <br>
    <br>
	Then, a small visible door opened up for him to enter. Behind him, the aggresive airship continued to hiss—quickly, he passed through the entrance without even looking back. As soon as he stepped inside the wall completely, the door zipped closed and the white sand was nowhere to be seen.
