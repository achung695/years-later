        <h1>1. A Girl in a Glass Tube</h1>
        
        <p>Year 12,018 B.C.—New Age Year 6,056 (N.A.)
<hr />
    <br>
    <br>
	“Hey! Wait up!” 
    <br>
    <br>
	Five-year-old Chris exclaimed, trying to catch the hand of his little buddy, Lena.
    <br>
    <br>
	“Nope! You’re too slow. Besides, do you think I’d give up the good seat for the once-in-a-while showing of our marvelous digital server? An epitome of human technology, as our Teacher always says! I want to know what’s going on in the world!”
    <br>
    <br>
	“That’s precisely why you have to slow down! I need that seat today. Last time, you got to sit in the front-view seat!”
    <br>
    <br>
	But, young and naive eight-year-old Chris’s short legs betrayed him, and the distance between him and athletically capable Lena gradually became wider and wider. Chris started huffing when his lungs started to give out, and Lena turned a corner when Chris tripped over a wire and fell. While he massaged his reddened face, which was scratched as he crashed on the metallic floor face-down, he caught a sight of an unusual door leading to a mysterious room on his right. 
    <br>
    <br>
	Meanwhile, Lena had turned a corner and was nowhere to be seen—none of the “Supervisors” were around to monitor him either. So, he decided to venture through the mysterious door in an irresistable curiosity of a child.
    <br>
    <br>
	He carefully unlatched the security lock of the door, creaking it open with two hands. Tip-toeing, he slipped smoothly into the place, a room full of sound-producing machineries and with a giant glass tube right in the middle. But what felt most striking to Chris was that a girl—about his age—was sleeping inside that gigantic glass tube, wires connected to all her body parts.
    <br>
    <br>
	“Who is this…is she even alive?”
    <br>
    <br>
	Just then, the girl’s eyes opened slowly. Chris jumped back in shock, thinking that he had caused this change of state—but really, it was time that the girl in the glass tube waked up. On one side of the room, 9 wide computer monitors hung on the wall, beeping while monitoring the girl’s vitals—her heartbeat, breathing per minute, circulation. When she opened her eyes fully, she slowly moved her blue pupils toward the ceiling, as though checking something. Then, eventually, she lazily closed her eyes again, falling into a light slumber again.
    <br>
    <br>
	Chris sighed in relief. If he was found in this secret, dangerous-looking room, he would be in a big trouble. Somehow, he got this gut feeling that this room was extremely important to them all—hence, he had to get out now, before any of the Supervisors or Teachers tracked him down. Lena would be looking for him too—he couldn’t risk any more of his safety for his curiosity.
    <br>
    <br>
	Just when he turned to leave the room, a robotic girl’s voice sounded from behind.
    <br>
    <br>

	“—Don’t leave…meadfasf…please. If…you…do—lwzehsdxlcxz—please come back….”</p>
    <br>
    <br>
	“…….” 
    <br>
    <br>
	But, before Chris knew, he was out the door, panting in fear and confusion.
