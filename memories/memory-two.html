	My second memory at C.C.C. is endeavoring to stand up and walk. My legs had no strength at all—because as I recall, I slept during the majority of days and nights of my existence. I had no sense of time, because my real life happened in my dreams. Haha, funny, right?
    <br>

	In my dreams, oddly enough, a boy came to me to talk with me. A stout, cute boy with short legs and white hair—I quite liked him, despite his naive personality and a little awkwardness. Because he was kind to me…for the first time since I was born. Yes, he was my first and only friend.

	You know, spending all this time inside a glass cage all by myself…it gets lonely. So, this boy in my dreams used to tell me stories of him playing with his classmates. It seemed like he had a fun life. I wish I could’ve spent my time with all those people, too….
