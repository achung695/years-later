	My first memory at the Central Connection Center (C.C.C.) for modern humans was looking up to a monotonous ceiling, hearing a distant laughter partly concealed by the acute machinery sounds, and feeling numb to my core. Where was I, after all? As I recall, at that point of my life—the starting point—I already possessed a body of a young girl, curves of puberty just starting to appear here and there. I noticed this in the following days just after my very first memory, when I first managed to set my spine upright and look into my own reflection in a nearby glass pane, which was so cleanly wiped. A girl with short, straight hair, a body wrapped up in a gray suit connected to various wires, and a pair of unsettlingly blue eyes were all I saw, and it felt extremely odd to see myself like that—especially for the first time. But soon, as everything gets with a passage of time, the things I saw and heard in the place—the changeless ceiling, the beeping noises, my own reflection—became as normal as inhaling and exhaling periodically.
